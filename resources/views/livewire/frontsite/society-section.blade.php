                    Society of Renewable Energy Systems, Power Plant and Electric Vehicles Technology (SO-RESPECT) is a
                    subsidiary organization of IESTA. It is also a non-government organization established to promote
                    sciences, to carry out technology transfer and the acceleration of renewable energies and electric
                    vehicles utilization, as well as to support the educational programs for society in mastering
                    physics
                    and chemistry.

                    The SO-RESPECT expects young generations to deep learn basic sciences including chemistry and
                    physics.
                    Inventions of new and renewable energies are initiated from well-structured talents and
                    comprehensions
                    about chemistry and physics. Energy conversion and storage technologies have been challenging issues
                    in
                    renewable energy era. Currently there are two major options for electric energy storages i.e.,
                    battery
                    bank storage or hydrogen tank storage. Both issues not only affect the power plant technology
                    development in the future but also affect the electric vehicles (EV) technology development.
                    Currently,
                    EVs can be categorized into battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs),
                    plug-in
                    hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV) that stores energy source in
                    a
                    hydrogen tank. In the future, hydrogen production technology could potentially introduce new vehicle
                    counterparts. Using hydrogen tank, an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle can be converted
                    partially or transformed directly to be a hydrogen ICE vehicle (HICEV) with minimum low-cost spare
                    parts
                    replacement. FCEVs produce zero emission, while HICEVs release near zero emission. HICEVs still emit
                    trace amount of CO2 and small amount of NOx. This is a remain challenge for young generations to
                    suppress the carbon emission of the HICEVs.

                    Green hydrogen production has been an impressive and hot topic nowadays. Hydrogen energy can be
                    obtained from the electrolysis reactions of Water (H2O), which are the most dominant substances or
                    material on earth beside Oxygen (O2). Green hydrogen production relates to water splitting
                    technology, which makes use of photon energy that is converted to be thermal and electric energies.
                    Both are essential energies to split Hydrogen (H2) and Oxygen (O2) from water.
